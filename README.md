## Introduction
 Semantics-aware abstractive multimodal summarization with multimodal output is a cutting-edge approach that combines the strengths of semantic understanding and abstraction with multimodal data, such as text, images, and possibly other modalities like audio or video. This method aims to generate concise summaries that capture the essence of the input information across multiple modalities, providing a richer and more comprehensive understanding. By incorporating semantic understanding, the system can produce summaries that go beyond simple extraction, creating outputs that are coherent, informative, and contextually relevant.
